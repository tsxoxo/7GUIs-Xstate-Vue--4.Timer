# Timer

_4th task of the [7 GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis)._

Made with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Xstate](https://stately.ai/docs) -- a framework for using finite state machines (FSM).

## Similar examples
These are all official [Xstate examples](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/tree/main/examples) -- a highly recommended resource.

They don't use Vue but were helpful for figuring out the logic and syntax -- things like actor invocation and eventless (always) transitions (and when and where to use them).
